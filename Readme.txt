Swag Labs (https://www.saucedemo.com):
Swag Labs is a fake online store.
In this store, you can find some fake clothes in many options.
In fact, this is a UI website functioning for engineers' playground.
This tool, can be very useful for UI developers and QA engineers as well and help them to create their product.
You can found four users on the login page, with their credentials.
Any user and the special role for the demonstration.
Once you login into the store (with one of the users), you can pick whatever you like, enter your name and address, and a Pony will be on his way with your package.
No worries, in this store, you do not need to pay ;)
So have fun
